    </p>

    <p>
      You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in
      the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Flour</strong>: This muffin recipe starts with all-purpose
        flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Baking powder</strong>: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which
        means it helps the muffins rise.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but
        it won't make the muffins taste salty.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sugar</strong>: White sugar lends sweetness to the muffins.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Egg</strong>: An egg adds moisture and helps bind the muffin
        batter together.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Milk</strong>: A cup of milk gives the muffins moisture and
        flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Oil</strong>: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, adds
        moisture without imparting flavor.
      </li>
    </ul>
